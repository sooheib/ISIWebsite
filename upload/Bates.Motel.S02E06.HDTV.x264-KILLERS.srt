00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,220
All right, who's next?

358
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,455
- Norman?
- I don't know.

359
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:30,424
Gunner looks kind of blue.

360
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,226
[Laughs] That's 'cause it's cold.

361
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,462
That's not a reason to not go and do it.

362
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:37,030
Come on. I'm gonna do it.

363
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,999
Yeah. Yeah, you just...

364
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,467
You just run and jump, huh?

365
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:43,303
Yeah, and don't forget to let go.

366
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,240
It's not brain surgery.

367
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,477
It looks kind of exciting.

368
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:53,080
[Laughs]

369
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,284
[Clears throat]

370
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:58,919
[Sighs]

371
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,321
Hoo!

372
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,257
Aah!

373
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,993
[Laughs] Aah!

374
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,330
Oh!

375
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,999
[Laughter]

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,168
Mother!

377
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,269
[Laughs]

378
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,206
Oh. Right to the bone.

379
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:21,542
- You're not cold?
- You kidding me?

380
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,410
Gonna have a frickin' heart attack.

381
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,913
Ah, I wish I could do it.

382
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,081
Can't you just take that
stuff out for a second?

383
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,184
Yeah, well, I do sometimes.

384
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:31,819
I don't think that's a good idea.

385
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,453
God, Norman, stop
worrying about everything.

386
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,922
She can totally do this.

387
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,391
I want to try.

388
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,860
You sure? It's really cold.

389
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,595
Yeah, I'm completely sure.

390
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,064
Guys, stop treating her
like she's made of glass.

391
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,132
Emma!

392
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:48,535
It will be fine. Okay.

393
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,571
Here I go!

394
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:53,040
[Screams and laughs]

395
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,346
[Laughs]

396
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,052
Emma?

397
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,122
Emma!

398
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,858
Get her tank.

399
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,293
Emma!

400
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,995
It's okay.

401
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,565
Get her tank and some blankets!

402
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,270
[Gasping]

403
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:28,175
- Come on!
- [Coughing]

404
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:31,578
Let's go.

405
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,915
Now, breathe, okay? In and out.

406
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:38,418
All right, nice and easy.
Don't think about anything else.

407
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:48,395
[Crying]

408
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,030
What the hell do you think you were doing

409
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,032
- telling her to do that?
- I didn't know.

410
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,834
She could've died, and it
would've been your fault!

411
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:57,504
Everyone isn't just some
toy for you to play with!

412
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,906
Listen, man, she didn't know.

413
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:02,009
Shut up and stay out of this!

414
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:15,656
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:22,195
I'm so sorry.

416
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:25,632
It's okay. I'm here.

417
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,411
Hey.

418
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:35,813
You ready to learn everything

419
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,818
you never wanted to know
about local politics?

420
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,150
Thank God, I actually got an appointment

421
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,518
with the mayor tomorrow.

422
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,855
I'm panicking. Come on in.

423
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:48,226
So nice of you to come
and help me with this.

424
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:51,495
Christine said that
you used to be a lawyer?

425
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,497
Yeah, for a while. Corporate law.

426
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,466
Why'd you stop?

427
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,469
Uh, well...

428
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,571
Okay, there's this old John Ford movie

429
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,073
<i>called The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,</i>

430
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,841
and it's about this
young, idealistic lawyer

431
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:05,977
who goes to this wild
west town to civilize it.

432
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,745
Yeah, I know that movie. I love it.

433
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,847
So do I.

434
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,854
Anyway, I always identified

435
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,022
with that guy for some reason, the lawyer.

436
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:19,523
He was brave,

437
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,691
and he cared about people and justice,

438
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,660
so I went to law school.

439
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:24,128
And then?

440
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,663
And then my ex-wife found out

441
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,164
how much public defenders make a year,

442
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,799
and suddenly, I was at a white-shoe firm

443
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,868
doing mergers and acquisitions.

444
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:32,837
Trust me, you can only do that for so long

445
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:34,839
before you start sounding
like Scrooge Mcduck.

446
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,576
[Laughs]

447
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:39,710
Okay, should I just dive in?

448
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:42,913
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

449
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,716
My parents look like they should be

450
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,919
on the cover of an
album from the late '60s.

451
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:52,056
My dad started growing weed
for him and some of his buddies,

452
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:54,458
and turns out he kind
of had a knack for it.

453
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,062
It was awesome weed,
and everybody wanted it.

454
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,931
He was kind of a botanical artist.

455
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:04,669
And pretty soon, he had
this big business going.

456
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,772
Then, my parents both died
and left me the business,

457
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:10,875
whether I wanted it or not.

458
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:25,523
This is incredible.

459
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:28,693
Come on. Check it out.

460
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:32,897
How many strains you got going here?

461
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:34,498
[Laughs] At one time?

462
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:38,035
I don't know. Maybe 20, 30 varieties.

463
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:39,870
I blend them.

464
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:42,173
I crossbreed them.

465
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,809
It's the part I love.

466
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,712
Yeah, I can tell.

467
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:53,684
I need you to do something for me.

468
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,953
Oh, yeah? What's that?

469
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,656
I never should've given
my brother Gil's position.

470
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:02,493
He can't handle it.

471
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,028
Relax, this isn't a test.

472
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:08,799
I'm not gonna cut off your
head if you betray Zane.

473
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,802
That's good to know.

474
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:14,238
But here's what I need you to do for me.

475
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,241
I need you to watch him.

476
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,843
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

477
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,812
Basically, I want you to run things

478
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:24,915
without letting him know
that you're running things.

479
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:29,987
It's not gonna be hard.

480
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:33,824
Speaking of running things,

481
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,193
if you're in charge,
how come I never see you?

482
00:25:36,294 --> 00:25:38,162
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

483
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,465
That's kind of funny.

484
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,702
I mean, you really seem to like dirt.

485
00:25:44,803 --> 00:25:49,173
I do like dirt.

486
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,908
It's honest.

487
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,147
And so my question would be two-pronged.

488
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:59,517
What are the city's goals with
regards to historic properties,

489
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,185
and what are the city's responsibilities?

490
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:03,988
- Norma.
- What? What'd I do wrong?

491
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,157
Nothing. But it's... it's not...

492
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,625
It's not about that.

493
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:08,926
You're fine,

494
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,529
and you've clearly done the research.

495
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:14,465
But that's not what's
gonna get you this seat.

496
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:17,134
Well, so what is?

497
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:18,936
Look.

498
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,871
You don't have to impress anyone

499
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,140
that you're competent or
informed or intelligent.

500
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,976
That's all very obvious.

501
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,978
But there's a... There's a depth

502
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,482
and a presence and a force about you

503
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,550
that's so engaging.

504
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:36,187
You've got to let that show.

505
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:38,889
Norma Bates is a lovely,
poised, competent woman,

506
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,491
who just happens to know

507
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:41,959
about municipal code
violations and overlay zones.

508
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,494
That's it.

509
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,529
Don't... don't be so worried

510
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:47,665
about bringing all this
information to the meeting,

511
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,467
that you leave yourself at home,

512
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,969
'cause you're the best part.

513
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:56,974
Thank you.

514
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,544
You're welcome.

515
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:18,796
[Whispers] Are you awake?

516
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:20,898
I am now.

517
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:26,837
Don't take this personally.

518
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:29,173
I won't.

519
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,161
Hello?

520
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,478
- Hey, Emma.
- Oh.

521
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,714
You... You feeling better today?

522
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,983
Fine. I-I shouldn't have done that.

523
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:12,653
I don't know what I was trying to prove.

524
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,489
Oh, yeah, I don't know what
any of us were trying to prove.

525
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:18,358
I just wanted to say thank you for...

526
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,428
Possibly saving my life.

527
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,531
Oh, no, I don't think I did.

528
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:28,502
I, um,

529
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,903
I lost it a bit.

530
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:33,907
You know, I hope I didn't embarrass you.

531
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:36,376
No, it was what it was.
It was a little scary,

532
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:38,445
and... and you just reacted.

533
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:40,481
Yeah.

534
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,350
Did I overreact?

535
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:46,487
Overreact?

536
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:49,723
You know, like, the
world's coming to an end.

537
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:52,359
You seemed upset.

538
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,695
You know, in a way that
a person would be upset

539
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:57,898
if someone they cared about might be hurt.

540
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,533
You're... You're just sensitive,

541
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,368
and to be honest, it
was nice to have someone

542
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:04,505
be that upset on my behalf.

543
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,809
Yeah, so it all just seemed normal.

544
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:10,978
You're asking the wrong person.

545
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,680
I don't really know what "normal" means.

546
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:16,884
But I don't want you to
worry about it, please.

547
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,488
You okay?

548
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,025
Oh, yeah. No, I'm... I'm fine.

549
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:26,026
I was just wondering how you were.

550
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,561
I'm glad you're better.

551
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:30,564
I am gonna get working on my crow.

552
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:33,066
Well, yeah, sure. I'll
let you get back to work.

553
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,803
I, um, just...

554
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:40,174
Just wanted to say thank you, Norman.

555
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,410
Yeah. You're welcome.

556
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,512
Yeah.

557
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:55,923

the integrity of... wow.

We... we have to regulate
the construction density.

562
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:06,800
What time are you... what
time are you meeting the mayor?

563
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:10,604
2:00. Can I tell you my points again?

564
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:12,506
Mom, I've heard them many times.

565
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,141
- You know them.
- I know.

566
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,578
I know, and George told me not
to focus on the information.

567
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:19,413
- George did?
- Yeah.

568
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:20,514
He came by and helped me yesterday.

569
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:22,616
He's so nice.

570
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:26,086
What exactly did he tell you to focus on?

571
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:28,188
He told me that I shouldn't be so focused

572
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,657
on reciting facts that
I forget to bring myself,

573
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,760
that I'm the best part.

574
00:30:36,197 --> 00:30:37,464
Yeah, George is right.

575
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:40,000
You should listen to George.

576
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:42,469
I got to go to the hardware store

577
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,039
and get glue for the glue gun.

578
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,708
Oh, and don't forget my
driver's test in the morning.

579
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:49,476
I'm not gonna forget.

580

When's the last time I
forgot an appointment for you?

- Norman?
- What?

582
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:56,450
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

583
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,619
Getting this seat means everything to us.

584
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,588
Good luck, mother.

585
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:04,758
They'd be lucky to get you
on their stupid council.

586
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:18,005
The mayor is ready for you, Mrs. Bates.

587
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:32,920
I understand that coastal
development is necessary,

588
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:36,023
but it really needs to
be seriously controlled,

589
00:31:36,124 --> 00:31:39,459
in order to maintain a
kind of quality of life

590
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:40,961
that I think we're all used to living here

591
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:44,598
in Pine White Bay... Or White Pine Bay.

592
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,569
So how do you know the Heldens?

593
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:52,706
Oh, Christine and I met
at community theater.

594
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,375
Ah. I love them both.

595
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:57,744
They're really great friends of mine,

596
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:59,579

They're great.

And you also know Nick Ford.

Yes, I do.

601

He also has really great
things to say about you,

602
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:22,803
and he really wants you to have this seat.

603
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:27,507
I appreciate his support.

604
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:30,911
Well, his support means something.

605
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:34,982
You really don't want to cross Nick Ford.

606
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:38,385
No, I don't suppose you do.

Thank you for stopping by.

610

Oh, you don't want me to
talk about my positions on...

611
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,429
Well, no, judging by the company you keep,

612

I know all that I need to know.

613
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,571
So it was nice to meet you, Norma.

614
00:32:57,672 --> 00:33:00,073
- Nice to put a face to the name.
- Yeah.

615
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:02,409
You've made a really big impression

616
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:04,378
around here in a short time.

617
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,846
Well, that wasn't my intent.

618
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:08,515
I just wanted to move to a
nice, quiet town with my son.

619
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,417
Well, it's worked out for you.

620
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:14,921
You are in with all the right people.

621
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,390
- Okay, sure thing.
- So, uh...

Thanks again for stopping by.

623
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,127
I'll be making my decision very quickly.

Yeah.

642
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:15,126
Is he all right?

643
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:18,663
Well, he's sensitive and emotional.

644
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,868
Why? What happened?

645
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,103
What?

646
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:27,672
Please, tell me.

647

He's blacked out twice in front of me,

648
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:31,609
and he told me it's happened before.

649

Blacked out? You mean fainted?

650
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:36,481
- He fainted once at school.
- No, he, like, leaves his body.

651
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,916
He can physically move
and even talk a little,

652

but he's not in there.

653

Well, he told me not to tell his mom,

657
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:54,499
but now I'm worried I
should be telling someone,

658

'cause maybe there's
something really wrong with him

659

00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,509
when he's been with her,
like he's sleepwalking.

714
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,079
And he told her it had happened before.

715
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,415
I guess he told her not to
tell you, but she was worried.

716
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:56,950
She didn't know if she
should tell you anyways,

717
00:37:57,051 --> 00:37:59,186
so she told me.

718
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:01,555
And I'm telling you.

719
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,691
I'm sorry.

720
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,533
Thanks, Emma. It's okay. Bye.

721
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:24,377
Can someone get their license

722
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:28,014
if they've been experiencing blackouts?

723
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,917
- Mother, what are you talking...
- Norman.

724
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,152
Has he experienced a loss of consciousness

725
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:33,887
in the last three years?

726
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:36,389
Yes, he has.

727
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:39,059
- [Scoffs]
- [Unbuckles seat belt]

728
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:42,195
I'm sorry,

729
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,264
but he absolutely can't get a license.

730
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:48,135
He can apply in three years,
if he has no recurrences.

731
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:51,271
[Car door closes]

732
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:59,546
[Soft music]

733
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:13,059
You have to talk to me eventually.

734
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,962
How could you do that to me?

735
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,365
How could I not? It's not safe.

736
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:20,167
Why, all of a sudden, do you even think

737
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:21,401
I'm having blackouts?

738
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:24,137
[Sighs] Norman, I just know.

739
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,372
Well, I want to know how you know,

740
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,240
because I don't believe you know.

741
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,575
I just think you're think
you're making all this up

742
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,310
because you don't want me to drive.

743
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,213
Cody Brennen told Emma.
She was worried about you.

744
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:34,381
Cody, huh?

745
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:38,351
Yeah, I warned you about her.

746
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:40,187
- Pull over.
- No, I'm not gonna pull over.

747
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,024
- I said pull over!
- [Tires screech]

748
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,528
[Car horn blares]

749
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:51,064
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone, mother.

750
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:53,533
I don't want to. I'm worried.

751
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:56,536
Where are you going?

752
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:59,072
Go home, mother.

753
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,375
I'm not a little boy.

754
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,510
You can't keep me locked up in our house

755
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,579
for the rest of my life.

756
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,582
Since I can't drive, I'm walking.

757
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:09,683
Now, go home.

758
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,025
Okay, Norman. Okay.

759
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:47,320
[Pounding on door]

760
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:50,156
- Norman, what?
- Why did you tell Emma?

761
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:51,291
I was worried about you.
I didn't know what to do.

762
00:40:51,392 --> 00:40:52,592
How could you do that to me?

763
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,227
- I trusted you!
- Shh. My dad's asleep.

764
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,662
He's been working all
night. You need to go.

765
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:57,564
I don't care.

766
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,099
I'm sorry, Norman, it seemed
like the right thing to do.

767
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,300
How could it be the right thing to do

768
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,601
when I specifically said

769
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:03,169
I didn't want to worry my mother?

770
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:04,938
I didn't tell your mom. I told Emma.

771
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,106
Well, that's as good as telling my mom.

772
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:09,009
I got to go work all night.

773
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,144
What the hell's going on out here, hmm?

774
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,213
Nothing, dad.

775
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:17,183
What's this guy doing here?

776
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:19,219
I don't need this right now, Cody.

777
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,087
I came here to talk to your daughter.

778
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,224
What?

779
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:25,892
Just go back to bed, dad. [Screams]

780
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:27,560
He goes, all right? Then I deal with you.

781
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:30,997
Let go of her! [Grunts]

782
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:33,266
Bringing your trashy, little
hookups back to my house?

783
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,401
It's not a hookup!

784
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:36,303
Leave her alone!

785
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:37,637
Dad!

786
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,077
